# Giles High School Cadences

-	`cadence.pdf` is the score
-	`cadence-1.pdf` is the snare part
-	`cadence-2.pdf` is the tenors part
-	`cadence-3.pdf` is the bass part
-	`cadence-4.pdf` is the cymbals part
-	`cadence.ly` is the "code" that was used to write the sheet music. Learn [Lilypond](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Lilypond) if you want to edit/write your own sheet music for free.

__To download one file__, go into the `Cadences` folder, find the music you want, and click the `Download` button somewhere in the upper right corner. This should work on phones [untested] and computers.

__To download everything__, either follow [this link](https://github.com/patthomasrick/ghs-cadences/archive/master.zip) or click the `Clone or download` button, then `Download ZIP`. You'll have to do this on a computer.

Enjoy my hard work.
